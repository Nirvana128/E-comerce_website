# E-Commerce

## Project Idea
- The project is aimed at building a Django + React web application that will help users interact with a specific service or product. The service can be an e-commerce platform or any domain-specific web application (e.g., blog, social networking, etc.).

## Problem Statement
- The current market lacks a comprehensive, user-friendly, and scalable platform where users can seamlessly interact with the service, manage their profiles, make transactions, and view dynamic content in real time.

## User Personas
-	**Admin User**: Manages the platform, adds/removes content, and handles system settings.
-	**End User**: Consumers who use the platform for browsing or purchasing.

## High-Level Functional Requirements
- User registration and login (using Django authentication).
-	A user dashboard that shows the products or services.
-	Admin interface to add, modify, or delete items.
-	Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop.
-	Basic shopping cart or similar feature.

## High-Level Non-Functional Requirements
-	Scalability to support a large number of users.(100)
-	Security with encrypted user data.
-	Optimized for fast loading speeds.
-	Usable on mobile and tablet devices.
